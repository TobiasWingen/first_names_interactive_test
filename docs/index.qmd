This website presents stereotypic ratings of first names, as judged by
German participants under laboratory conditions. For detailed
information about the methodology, please refer to [Speckmann and Wingen (2023)](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/full/10.1027/2151-2604/a000515) . It is important to note that these ratings were provided by a
non-representative sample of students and do not reflect actual
attributes of individuals bearing these names.
